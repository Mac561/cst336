                        Moravec's paradox can be extended to many forms of social intelligence. 
                        Distributed multi-agent coordination of autonomous vehicles remains a difficult problem.[125] 
                        Affective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems which recognize, interpret, 
                        process, or simulate human affects. Moderate successes related to affective computing include 
                        textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal affect analysis (see multimodal sentiment analysis), 
                        wherein AI classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject.</p>

                       <p >In the long run, social skills and an understanding 
                       of human emotion and game theory would be valuable to a social agent. 
                       Being able to predict the actions of others by understanding their motives and 
                       emotional states would allow an agent to make better decisions. Some computer systems mimic 
                       human emotion and expressions to appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, 
                       or to otherwise facilitate humanâ€“computer interaction. Similarly, some virtual assistants are programmed to 
                       speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; this tends to give naive users an unrealistic conception of how 
                       intelligent existing computer agents actually are.</p>
