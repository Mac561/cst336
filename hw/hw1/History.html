               <p> AI research was first discover at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956. </p> 
                and the fiunders and leaders of AI at that time were:
                 
                <ul>
                    
                     <li> Allen Newell (CMU)</li> 
                     <li> Herbert Simon (CMU)</li> 
                     <li> John McCarthy (MIT)</li> 
                     <li> Marvin Minsky (MIT)</li> 
                     <li> Arthur Samuel (IBM)</li> 
                  
                </ul>
               <p>They and their students produced 
                programs that the press described as <i> "astonishing":</i>  </p> 
                <p>computers were learning checkers strategies (and by 1959 were 
                reportedly playing better than the average human),</p> 
                <p> solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems (Logic Theorist, first run c. 1956) 
                and speaking English.[33] By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the<abbr title="Department of Defense">DOD</abbr> and laboratories had 
                been established around the world. AI's founders were optimistic about the future
