                        AI is heavily used in robotics. Advanced robotic arms and other 
                        industrial robots, widely used in modern factories, can learn from experience how 
                        to move efficiently despite the presence of friction and gear slippage. A modern 
                        mobile robot, when given a small, static, and visible environment, can easily determine its location and 
                        map its environment; however, dynamic environments, such as (in endoscopy) the interior of a patient's breathing 
                        body, pose a greater challenge. Motion planning is the process of breaking down a movement task into "primitives" 
                        such as individual joint movements. Such movement often involves compliant motion, a process where movement requires 
                        maintaining physical contact with an object.</p>

                       <p> Moravec's paradox generalizes that low-level sensorimotor 
                        skills that humans take for granted are, counterintuitively, difficult to program into a robot; the paradox is named 
                        after Hans Moravec, who stated in 1988 that "it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level 
                        performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills 
                        of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility". This is attributed to the fact that, 
                        unlike checkers, physical dexterity has been a direct target of natural selection for millions of years.</p>
